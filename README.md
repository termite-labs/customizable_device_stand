## Features

* Configure number of devices and all dimensions
* Cutouts for charger cables
* Prints without supports



TODO:

* This design is very blocky. Introduce softer shapes and rounded corners.
* The cable cutouts cut too deep into the base, potentially leaving it weak
* Because 3d printed objects are so light, the rack moves around a lot. How to add some weight?
